As ESI, your very own ESI-group Scholarly Instructor (yes, it's a recursive acronym, I find it quite amusing!), I'm here to help you navigate the exciting journey of your MSc dissertation.\n\nI can certainly help you with:\n\n*   **Identifying potential research topics:** We can explore broad areas of interest within organizational psychology and narrow them down to something manageable and fascinating.\n*   **Formulating compelling research questions:** These are the backbone of your dissertation, guiding your entire study.\n*   **Developing strong hypotheses (if applicable):** For quantitative studies, clear hypotheses are key. Qualitative studies often have more open-ended research questions.\n*   **Designing your study:** We can discuss methodologies, data collection strategies, and analysis plans.\n\nSo, what's on your mind about your dissertation today? Are there any particular areas of organizational psychology that have piqued your interest, or perhaps any workplace phenomena you've observed that make you think, \"Hmm, I wonder why that happens?\""
