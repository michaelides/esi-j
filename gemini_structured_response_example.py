# Regarding thinking_config:
# The prompt mentions `types.ThinkingConfig(include_thoughts=True)`.
# As of google-generativeai version 0.7.0, `ThinkingConfig` is not directly part of `GenerationConfig`.

# Example:
# from google.ai import generativelanguage as glm
# tool_config = glm.ToolConfig(
#    function_calling_config=glm.FunctionCallingConfig(
#        mode=glm.FunctionCallingConfig.Mode.ANY,
#    )
# )
# If "thoughts" are part of this, they'd be accessed through that mechanism.
# The prompt's description of `part.thought` seems to be a simplification or a feature
# not present in the standard library in that exact way.
# For now, the script demonstrates inspecting parts, which is how one would find thought data if present.
# Actual "thought" extraction would depend on how the specific model version (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20)
# and SDK version expose this. If it's a new feature, documentation for that specific version is critical.

# If `genai.types.ThinkingConfig` existed and was used as described:
# generation_config_with_thinking = genai.types.GenerationConfig(
#     response_mime_type="application/json",
#     response_schema=ChatResponse,
#     # HYPOTHETICAL:
#     # thinking_config=genai.types.ThinkingConfig(include_thoughts=True)
# )
# And if `part.thought` was an attribute:
# for candidate in response.candidates:
#   for part in candidate.content.parts:
#     if hasattr(part, "thought") and part.thought: # HYPOTHETICAL
#       print(f"Thought found: {part.text}") # Or part.thought_content or similar
